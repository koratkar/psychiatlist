A list of unusual things that have a large effect size on some people's depression.

This is not medical advice. Please use caution and common sense when implementing these protocols. 

I hope to evolve and expand this document over the next months and years – as well as to add supporting studies and mechanisms of action to what's essentially a few cobbled anecdotes. When this document is substantially larger, I'll add a ranking system by ease of use, cost, and nature of effect. For now, it's a list of pointers for further research. The information offered may actually make your depression worse.
